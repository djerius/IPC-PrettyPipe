=head1 NAME

B<IPC::PrettyPipe::Stream::Utils> - support utilities for streams

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IPC::PrettyPipe::Stream::Utils qw[ parse_spec ];

  $opc = parse_spec( $op );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Stream Specification

A stream specification is a string which may take one of the forms in
the I<Spec> column:

  Spec    Op    Mode    File    Function
  ----    ---  ----    ----    -----------------------
  <       <     I       y       read from file via fd 0
  <N      <     I       y       read from file via fd N
  >       >     O       y       write to file via fd 1
  >N      >     O       y       write to file via fd N

  >&      >&    O       n       redirect fd 2 to fd 1
  &>      &>    O       n       redirect fd 2 to fd 1

  N<&-    <&-   ?       n       close fd N

  M<&N    <&    I       n       dup fd M as fd N
  N>&M    >&    O       n       dup fd M as fd N

 where

=over

=item *

I<M> and I<N> are integers indicating file descriptors

=item *

C<Mode> indicates input (I<I>), output (I<O>), or not applicable (I<?>)

=item *

C<File> indicates whether an additional parameter with a file name is
required.

=back

Any resemblance to stream operators used by B<L<IPC::Run>> is purely
non-coincidental.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

B<IPC::PrettyPipe::Stream::Utils> exports the following functions upon
request:

=over

=item B<parse_spec>

  $components = parse_spec( $spec )

Parse a stream specification into components I<Op>, I<N>, and I<M>.
Returns a hashref with the information indexed by the component names.

If the specification indicates that additional parameters are required
(such as the name of a file to be read or written to), the key
C<param> will be set.
