	* PipeC.pm, test.pl: introduced change in behavior with addition of
	  firstvalue to valrep.

	  previously, if only one match was made and lastvalue was
	  specified, lastvalue would prevail.  the bogus behavior was that
	  lastvalue was only used if nmatch > 1.  now, if nmatch = 1 and
	  firstvalue isn't specified, it is set to lastvalue.  this
	  reestablishes the old behavior.
