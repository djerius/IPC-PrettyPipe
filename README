NAME

    PipeC - manage command pipes

DESCRIPTION

    PipeC provides a mechanism to maintain readable execution
    pipelines.  Pipelines are created by adding commands to a
    PipeC object.  Options to the commands are set using a
    readable format; PipeC takes care of quoting strings,
    sticking equal signs in, etc.  The pipeline may be rendered
    into a nicely formatted string, as well as being executed
    (currently by the Bourne shell, /bin/sh).
