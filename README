NAME

    IPC::PipeC - manage command pipes

DESCRIPTION

    IPC::PipeC provides a mechanism to maintain readable execution
    pipelines.  Pipelines are created by adding commands to a
    IPC::PipeC object.  Options to the commands are set using a
    readable format; IPC::PipeC takes care of quoting strings,
    sticking equal signs in, etc.  The pipeline may be rendered into a
    nicely formatted string, as well as being executed.

    None
