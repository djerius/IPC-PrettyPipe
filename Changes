  [BUILD FIX]

     * remove extraneous dependency on Exporter::Tiny. Jumped the gun
       on
       http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/0c9e658d-6c00-1014-9524-043f55012b15,
       which reported a problem, but it's with Type::Tiny; this module
       doesn't doesn't explicitly use it.  Might be a tester problem.

  [BUG FIX]

    - renderers/executors provided as class names were not properly
      handled

    - adding a stream to a pipe object was broken

    - the Template::Tiny renderer didn't properly quote arguments for
      the shell

  [ENHANCEMENT]

    - commands, attribute names, and attribute values now have a
      "quoted_" accessor which returns strings properly escaped for
      use by a shell.
